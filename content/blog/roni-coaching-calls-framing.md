### If We Long For Social Change That Supports More Care And Interdependence, We Need To Speak In Ways That Center Needs, Connection, And Choice.

[**Register now**](https://sites.google.com/view/whose-frame-is-it/registration)

Would you like to support others – and yourself – in **gently moving toward more shared understanding** and integration **without requiring anyone to agree** on values or how we speak?

 

Roni is offering a series of 6 weekly framing coaching calls on Sundays at 10:00 am PST / 1:00 pm EST / 18:00 UTC / 19:00 CET, starting March 5 2023. You can see a [full list of dates and times](https://sites.google.com/view/whose-frame-is-it) on the course website. 

 

Join us to practice how to **invite people into interdependence** in your daily conversations, how to engage with judgements, and what do you do when someone makes a comment that holds an assumption of scarcity, separation, or powerlessness. 

 

**Turn your longing for change into concrete and consistent action with skills and habits you can use every day!**
 

Not familiar with framing? No worries! You can register to watch the videos from Roni’s Framing For Integration course before we start. Or just join us if you’re comfortable with some potential confusion until you figure out the basics.
